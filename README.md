# BrewPlanEdit
Editor for ACP plans

ACP plans are .txt files with a variety of allowed commands, each with their own syntax. One can create and edit these plans with Notepad. This editor forces correct syntax, and provides help information for the commands.

A setup file is provided for easy installation.

Each command has a Help pane associated with it (from the ACP documentation). There is also an overalll Help file to describe features, usage, etc.
