    <h3>Field formatting</h3>
    Plan directives are added with default values for the various fields. These values are generally changed to whatever the user desires.
    For example, the Target directive shown above allows entry of the target name, or the optional RA/Dec coordinates.<p/>

    There are some validation checks on the fields, but these edits are by no means exhaustive.<p/>

    The fields to be edited have tooltips to remind the user what the field does; sometimes there is text next to the field as a reminder.<p/>

    <h3>ACP Help Information</h3>
    The information from the ACP User's Manual for each of the directives is presented for each directive. See the topic 
    <a href="ACPHelp.htm">ACP Help</a>. I just copied the ACP Help information; when Bob changes the documentation, those changes will not be automatically picked up by the editor.

    <h3>UTC/Local Time</h3>
    Several of the directives require date/time in UTC time. When editing the field the time is presented and input in the user's Local time units. 
    For example, I add a #shutdown directive to shut down at 8:30 in the morning my time (the time zone of my computer), and that time is 
    converted into UTC time by the editor. The local time is
    shown in the directive's comment for reference.<p/>

    <span id="directive">#shutdownat 12/11/15 1:30 PM &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;; local time 12/16/15 8:30 AM</span>

    <h3>Filter set Coordination</h3>
    See the topic <a href="ComboCmd.htm">Combined Filter Directive</a> for information on how this works. Basically, instead of entering individual 
    #count / #interval / #binning / #filter directives, the editor combines these into a single "block" of directives. This keeps them in sync with the same number of entries.

    <h3>Filter Sets</h3>
    The Preferences dialog allows entry of 3 different sets of up to 10 filters. This allows the Filter choices to be restricted to appropriate choices. No more mis-spelling
    of filter names.

    <h3>Comments</h3>
    A directive can be converted into a comment so it is inactive. Later, the commented directive can be uncommented when the user is ready to
    activate the directive.<p/>

    You can do some tricks with comments. For example, you cannot Add a #completionstate directive (you are not supposed to do that!). 
    However, you can add a comment, then fill it in with the #completionstate directive, then Uncomment the line. Voila! The desired
    #completionstate directive. 

    <h3>Directive Ordering</h3>
    Directives can be adjusted up or down in the plan as desired.

    <h3>Multiple Plans</h3>
    The user can open multiple editing tabs, each with a different plan. This makes it easy to compare plans.

    <h3>Warnings</h3>
    Directive errors can pop up warning messages. In addition, directives with potential issues (for example, a directive with a date before today) are marked with red text 
    in the plan list area.
