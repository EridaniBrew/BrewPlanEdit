    <h2>Combined Filter Directive</h2>
    <img src="images/Combo.jpg" /><p/>
    The #Count / #Interval / #Binning / #Filter directives are treated as a special case. They are combined into a single "directive"
    so they are always in sync with the same number of entries. The directives are written to the plan as individual lines.<p/>

    When reading the plan the individual directives may be in any order; however, the written plan will always have them in the same order.<p/>

    By default, the combined directive has all 4 directives (count, interval, binning, filter). Toggling the checkbox to the left
    of the individual lines will remove that particular line. <p/>
    
    For example, in the beginning of the plan you establish the 4 directives. Later you change the filters and interval, but leave the count and binning the same.<p/>
    <span id="directive">
        #count 10,12<br />
        #interval 120,120<br />
        #binning 2,2<br />
        #filter Red, Blue<p />
    </span>
    ... various targets, etc<p/>
        <span id="directive">
            #interval 240,240<br />
            #filter HAlpha, Oiii<p />
        </span>
    
    As a result of this combination there are no comments allowed on the individual lines (notice that the Note field does not appear).
    <p/>
    The combined directive can be converted into comments, then later uncommented.
    <p/>
    The filter names are loaded from the Preferences dialog. You can select one of three filter sets available.
