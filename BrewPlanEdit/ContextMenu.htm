    <h2>Context Menu</h2>

    Right clicking the Plan Directive List brings up a menu of operations.<p/>

    <p/>
    <h3>Add</h3>
    
    This leads to a series of directives which may be added. They are added with default values which can then be edited as desired.<p/>

    I have grouped the directives into (possibly arbitrary) groups to make it quicker to access a given directive.

    <h3>Add Alphabetical</h3>

    <img src="images/ContextMenuAlpha.jpg" />
    This rearranges the directives into alphabetical order. It may be easier to find directives alphabetically, 
    especially if you do not mentally group the directives the same way I do...

    <h3>Comment/Uncomment Line</h3>

    An existing directive may be converted to a comment:<p/>
    <span id="directive">#chill -10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ;#chill -10</span><p/>

    The comment may then be converted back to the directive with the Uncomment menu item.<p/>
    <span id="directive">;#chill -10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #chill -10</span><p />

    <h3>Move Up/Down</h3>

    These allow directives to be moved up or down in the plan.
    <h3>Delete</h3>
    This removes the directive from the plan. No, there is no Undo mechanism:)
