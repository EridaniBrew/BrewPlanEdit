    I have historically used Notepad to edit my plans for ACP. Occasionally I use ACP's Planner to initially generate a plan, but I always end up
    modifying that plan in Notepad. Usually I just copy an existing plan, then modify that plan for my new target.<p/>

    The problem is that I often want to add a plan directive, but I don't actually remember the format of the directive or what the various parameters might be. 
    Is it #WaitUntil or #ShutdownAt that has the Sets parameter?<p/>

    I also constantly screw up the format. For example, I change from 4 filters to 2 but forget to change the corresponding Count or Interval or Binning parameters. 
    Heaven forbid I should be able to convert Local time to UTC time for things like #waituntil. Of course, if I have a #shutdownat directive I always forget to 
    change the date to the next morning when I restart the plan the next night.<p/>

    I constantly restart my plans. Sometimes ACP immediately finds a problem (like mismatching #filter/ #count/ #interval/ #binning entries). 
    Often I don't realize I have an error until hours into the run...
    <p/>

    So, I wrote this editor to try and keep my plans a bit under control. See the <a href="Features.htm">Features</a> page for things it does.<p/>
    <p/>
    If you find issues with the editor, please drop me an email. Include a screenshot of the problem and a copy of the plan causing the issue to help me understand and debug the issue.<p/>
